# Seat Finder Application
This app assist users in identifying the location and type of berth based on a given seat number. In Indian trains, there are five different types of berths: Lower, Middle, Upper, Side Lower, and Side Upper.




## Methodology

* Building the UI - For building the seats. I have created special Widgets specifically 'UpSeatPainter' and 'DownSeatPainte'.Combining those 2 widget a new stateless widget 'cabin' is build to create a compartment.

* The cabin widget is used in listview.builder to build the coach.

* A text-field is used to get number input from user and the 'find' button is pressed to find the seat.

The app automatically scrolls to the location of the seat.
